  - Add methods for create, get_by_id, get_all, update, and delete operations
  - Write unit tests for all repository operations including edge cases
  - _Requirements: 8.1, 8.2_

- [x] 4. Implement habit service layer with business logic





  - Create HabitService class with methods for all habit operations
  - Implement streak calculation logic for consecutive day tracking and resets
  - Add validation for duplicate same-day completions and business rule enforcement

  --_Requirements: 5.1, 5.2, 5.3, 5.4, 5.5_

-

- [x] 7. Add statistics endpoint and calculations









  - Implement GET /stats endpoint with habit statistics calculations


  - Add logic to count total habits, completed today, and active streaks ≥3
  - Ensure statistics update dynamically based on current habit states
  - Write tests to verify statistics accuracy across different scenarios
  - _Requirements: 6.1, 6.2, 6.3_

- [x] 8. Add comprehensive error handling and validation










  - Ensure all validation errors return descriptive error messages

  - Implement custom exception classes for business logic errors

  - _Requirements: 7.2, 4.2, 5.4, 5.5_

- [x] 9. Create comprehensive test suite








  - Write integration tests for complete user workflows (create → complete → stats)
  - Add tests for streak reset scenarios and edge cases
  - Implement tests for data validation and error responses
  - Ensure test coverage meets minimum 90% requirement
  - _Requirements: 1.1, 1.4, 2.3, 5.1, 5.2, 5.3, 6.1, 6.2, 6.3_

- [x] 10. Finalize API documentation and validation
